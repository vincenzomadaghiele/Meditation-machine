Meditation Machine is a representation of complexity as human perceive it. As human reality, the single particles mutate too fast to be able to grasp each individual movement. If the listeners focus on a single particle they lose the bigger picture.

Meditation machine is the sonification of a particle system using a granular synthesizer. There is a one-to-one correspondence between particles and sound grains on 3D spatial position and stereo sound panning. The overall sound is then modified based on the relative positions of the particles and the density of the system. The nature of the system changes according to its parameters. By modifying the physical parameters that regulate the life of each particle new sonic and visual textures are generated.
