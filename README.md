Meditation Machine is a representation of complexity as human perceive it. As human reality, the single particles mutate too fast to be able to grasp each individual movement. If the listeners focus on a single particle they lose the bigger picture. 

###### N.B. This project builds on the excellent [tutorials on particle systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm34IcOOB40&list=PLRc5WfOZXC4kLfuYI5_xtb6-xBF78Z4fv&index=15) by Federico Foderaro - Amazing Max Stuff

Meditation machine is the sonification of a particle system using a granular synthesizer.
There is a one-to-one correspondence between particles and sound grains.

### Video Demo

Some samples of the possible sonic and visual results can be seen at:
